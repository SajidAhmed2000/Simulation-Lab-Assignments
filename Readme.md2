## Tasks Completed:
Use numpy to create a 3Ã—3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50.  
  Run the code twice
  With a fixed seed (`np.random.seed(10)`) to ensure reproducibility.  
  Without setting a seed, allowing random values to change each time.  
  Observe and explain the differences in outputs.(in a different cell as text)

## Concepts Covered:
- Matrix of random integers between 1 and 50.
- Matrix showcases.
- GitHub for version control.

## What I Learned:
- Generating Random Integers with matrices.
- Random Numbers Without a Fixed Seeds.
- Setting a Random Seed for Reproducibility.
- Uploading projects to GitHub.

## Submission:
The .ipynb file is uploaded in this repository.
