## Tasks Completed:

 - Loaded a dataset of temperature readings.
 - Standardized the data using mean and standard deviation.
 - Conducted a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to check normality.
 - Compared empirical CDF with the standard normal CDF.
 - Visualized both CDFs to interpret the K-S test result.
 

## Concepts Covered:

 - **NumPy:** Statistical operations like mean and standard deviation.
 - **SciPy:** Conducting a K-S test for normality.
 - **Matplotlib:** Visualization of empirical vs theoretical distributions.

## What I Learned:

 - How to standardize data using z-scores.
 - How the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used to test for normality.
 - How to visually compare empirical and theoretical distributions using CDFs.
 - Interpreting p-values and test statistics from the K-S test.

## Submission:
The `.ipynb` file containing this analysis and visualization has been uploaded in this repository.
